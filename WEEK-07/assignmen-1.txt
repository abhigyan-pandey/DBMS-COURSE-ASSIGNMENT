						//	================== 	SOLUTION	======================		//
						
						* In this table the primary key is the combination of VisitNo and  ProvNo column
						
	(1.)Updation Anamoly -->>  There will occur an updation anamoly if we want to change the ProvSpeciality beacause 
				    we will need to change all the rows which will be having the same doctor ,that's why 
				    time complexity will increase in updation.
	
	(2.)Deletion Anamoly -->> If we want to delete a patient detail from the table then , that doctor details will also
				   be deleted from the table.
